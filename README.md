# BugLogger

Bug Logger is a server/client that allows you to log bugs and other info to a database. The purpose of the system is to allow developers the ability to log bugs, debug info, and meta data to help solve problems.  

You can build the server from code using a Go compiler. The config.json file has the main configuration infor for the server to run. It was built to allow multiple databases if desired. Follow the server docs to see how to configure, run, and use the server.

The front-end is built using Flutter and has been designed for mobile, PWA, and Desktop. Feel free to review the code on how you can make it better fit your needs.
